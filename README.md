<h1>Web Beautiful Soup: </h1>
<p>
Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, making it easy to navigate and manipulate HTML content.

<h1> Project Overview: </h1>
<p>
My project is a web scraping endeavor using Python, BeautifulSoup, and other tools. It focuses on extracting information from the Billboard website, specifically the top 100 songs for a given year. The scraped data, including song titles, is then utilized to interact with the Spotify API using the Spotipy library. The project dynamically creates a private playlist on Spotify, incorporating songs from the Billboard charts of the specified year. This combination of web scraping and API interaction showcases the power of Python for automating tasks and integrating data from different sources.
